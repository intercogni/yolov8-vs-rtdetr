    "This comparison, based on benchmark data, illustrates the trade-offs between YOLOv8 and RT-DETR across different model sizes. RT-DETR models, particularly the larger variants, tend to achieve higher COCO AP at the cost of increased latency compared to YOLOv8. However, RT-DETR also offers competitive performance at lower latencies with its scaled variants. YOLOv8 models generally provide a good balance of speed and accuracy, especially the smaller variants, making them suitable for real-time applications where very low latency is critical. The choice between YOLOv8 and RT-DETR depends on the specific application requirements, balancing the need for accuracy against inference speed."
